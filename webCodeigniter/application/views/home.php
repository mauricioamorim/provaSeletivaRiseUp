<h1 class="mt-4">Rise Up REST Application</h1>
<p>For this exercise, you will have to create a small application displaying a list of users.</p>
<p>The app is in two parts, front-end and back-end.</p>

<h5 class="pt-3">Front-End</h5>
<p>The Front-end displays a list of users and a detail page for each of them. It is possible to make CRUD actions on them: create, update, delete. A beautiful user interface would be appreciated☺. The front-end must be developed on Codeigniter MVC Framework. It uses a REST Client (Curl, Guzzle…) to call the back-end API.</p>
<p>In this Front / Back model, there is no model on the front-end side, Controller call the back-end directly.</p>

<h5 class="pt-3">Back-End</h5>
<p>The back-end manages the database and shows REST API. API use an ORM or not to interact with the database. In Rise Up, we use NotORM.</p>
<p>You will have to create a User Resource to GET / POST / PUT / DELETE a user on the associated table.</p>
<p>On each action of the user, the front-end will communicate with the back-end in a Restful way.</p>

<h5 class="pt-3">Must-use technologies</h5>
<p>- PHP 7.4-fpm</p>
<p>- CodeIgniter (Front-End)</p>
<p>- Slim Framework (Back-End)</p>
<p>- Database of your choice</p>
